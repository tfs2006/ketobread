        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p>
          You followed a keto bread recipe, baked it with excitement, and... it tastes like an omelet. Not bread. Definitely not the crusty, satisfying loaf you were hoping for. If this sounds familiar, you're experiencing one of the most common complaints in keto baking.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news? Once you understand why this happens, you can fix it. Let's break down the causes and explore actionable solutions.
        </p>

        <!-- Causes Section -->
        <h2>Why Does This Happen?</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional bread relies on wheat flour and gluten for structure. Without gluten, keto bakers often turn to eggs as the primary binding and leavening agent. The result? Bread that's basically baked eggs with some flour mixed in.
        </p>
        <p>Here are the most common causes of eggy keto bread:</p>

        <h3>1. Too Many Eggs</h3>
        <p>
          Many keto bread recipes use 4, 5, or even 6 eggs per loaf. While eggs provide structure and help the bread rise, using too many overwhelms everything else. The egg flavor dominates, and the texture becomes rubbery and custard-like rather than bread-like.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Wrong Flour Ratios</h3>
        <p>
          Almond flour and coconut flour behave very differently from wheat flour—and from each other. Coconut flour absorbs far more liquid than almond flour. If your recipe doesn't balance these properly, you end up needing more eggs to compensate, which brings us back to the eggy problem.
        </p>

        <h3>3. No Flavor Balancing</h3>
        <p>
          Traditional bread has a distinctive taste from wheat, yeast fermentation, and often a touch of sweetness. Keto bread recipes that skip flavor-balancing ingredients end up tasting like nothing but eggs and fat.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Under-baking</h3>
        <p>
          Pulling your bread out too early leaves the center wet and custardy. This amplifies the eggy taste and texture. Keto breads often need lower heat and longer baking times than traditional bread.
        </p>

        <!-- Solutions Section -->
        <h2>5 Tips to Fix Eggy Keto Bread</h2>

        <h3>1. Use Fewer Whole Eggs, More Egg Whites</h3>
        <p>
          The egg yolk carries most of the distinctive egg flavor. Try using one or two whole eggs plus additional egg whites. This maintains structure while reducing the eggy taste. Some bakers use a ratio like 2 whole eggs plus 2-3 egg whites instead of 4-5 whole eggs.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Add Flavorful Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
          Mask the egg flavor with complementary tastes. Consider adding:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (also helps with rise)</li>
          <li>A small amount of keto-friendly sweetener</li>
          <li>Herbs like rosemary, thyme, or Italian seasoning</li>
          <li>Garlic powder or onion powder for savory loaves</li>
          <li>A pinch of quality salt (enhances all flavors)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Adjust Your Flour Blend</h3>
        <p>
          Experiment with the ratio of almond flour to coconut flour. Coconut flour absorbs more moisture, which can reduce the need for eggs. Some bakers also add a small amount of psyllium husk powder, which helps with binding and creates a more bread-like texture.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Bake Longer at Lower Temperature</h3>
        <p>
          Try baking at 325°F instead of 350°F, and extend your baking time. This allows the center to cook through without burning the outside. A fully-baked loaf has much less of that wet, eggy quality.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Let It Cool Completely</h3>
        <p>
          This sounds simple, but it matters. Keto bread continues to set as it cools. Cutting into it hot releases steam and leaves you with a gummy interior. Wait at least 30 minutes—ideally an hour—before slicing.
        </p>
