        <!-- Personal Experience Section -->
        <h2>My Experience with Keto Bread Baking</h2>
        <p>
          Baking keto bread is different from traditional bread making. Without gluten, you're working with ingredients that behave unpredictably. The first thing you notice is the smell—almond flour has a pleasant, slightly nutty aroma that fills the kitchen as it bakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The texture of well-made keto bread is surprisingly close to regular bread. The exterior develops a nice crust while the interior stays soft and slightly springy. It's not identical to wheat bread, but it scratches that itch when you're craving toast or a sandwich.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key is following the techniques carefully. Small things matter—how you measure your flour, how long you let the dough rest, and your oven temperature can make the difference between a good loaf and a disappointment. That's where having a dedicated cookbook with tested recipes really helps compared to random recipes found online.
        </p>

            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>Most recipes use common keto baking ingredients like almond flour, coconut flour, eggs, butter, and psyllium husk powder. You may need to purchase some specialty items if you don't already have them, but these are widely available at grocery stores or online.</p>

          <details class="faq__item">

          <details class="faq__item">
            <summary>How many carbs are in these bread recipes?</summary>
            <div class="faq__answer">

              <p>Many recipes contain tree nuts (almond flour), eggs, and dairy. If you have allergies to these ingredients, some recipes may not be suitable. The cookbook focuses on traditional keto baking ingredients, so nut-free alternatives aren't extensively covered.</p>
